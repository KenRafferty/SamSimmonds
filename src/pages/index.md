  description: >
    Franklin Adin Simmonds F.R.C.S. (31 October 1910 - 14 July 1983; also known
    as Sam Simmonds) was a British orthopaedic surgeon for whom the Simmonds'
    test on rupture of the Achilles tendon is named. He also worked with the
    pioneering surgeon John Charnley on hip replacement surgery and became an
    expert in this field.


    He very much disliked his given names and in adult life was universally
    known as Sam.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
